### Introduction

Over the course of this project I have been pushed in terms of my coding ability which has been challenging but also interesting. I have had to filter through code to find I have one semi colon out of place which stopped everything from working. It's been tedious.

But overall this project has pushed me and I have enjoyed it, it has giving me a chance to refresh my memory on CSS, HTML and Javascript. Creating our own databases and a form that pushes data to it was enjoyable, getting the data to show up on our sites was a challenge but we got there.
